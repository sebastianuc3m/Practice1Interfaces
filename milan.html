      <h2>Milan</h2>
      <p> Milan has been interesting and vibrant at least since it was the
        capital of the western half of the Roman Empire. It was one of the most
        glorious of the Italian Comuni during the Middle Ages. It housed one of
        Italy’s most spectacular courts during the Renaissance. And so on.
        Leonardo da Vinci came from Florence looking for work and ended up
        staying a long time and achieving quite a lot, like many others have
        done since. Having always been in the thick of things, Milano is gifted
        with an impressive part of Italy’s heritage: it is a great city of art.
        <br>
        Have a look at the imposing marble Duomo, at our churches, palaces and
        museums. You will also be delighted by contemporary art and architecture.
        Countless works of art are waiting for you, and nearly all of them are
        within walking distance.
        <br>
        While you visit, let the atmosphere of Italy’s most modern and advanced
        city seep in. You will be captured by the elegance and style; by the
        energy and the international flair. An incredible shopping experience
        for all tastes and pockets, in a place where design and fashion have
        made their home.
        <br>
        Milan is the hub of Italian culture, music, media and sports. If you
        are a music lover, you can’t miss La Scala. If you are a sports fan,
        no other city can probably boast two soccer powerhouses like Inter
        Milan and AC Milan. With so many things to do and see, take the time to
        simply enjoy yourself – relax and sip an aperitivo while you consider your
        options for dinner. Milan provides an overwhelming dining experience, as
        all Italian regional cuisines are richly represented, along with many
        others from the rest of the world.
